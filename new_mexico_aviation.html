            <h2>FAA Certification: The Foundation</h2>
            <p>Becoming a certified Aviation Technician in the United States typically requires obtaining an Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This certification demonstrates that a technician has the knowledge and skills necessary to safely maintain and repair aircraft.</p>

            <h2>Community College Programs</h2>
            <p>New Mexico offers excellent community college programs that provide comprehensive training for aspiring aviation technicians. These programs often combine classroom instruction with significant hands-on experience.</p>
            <h3>Central New Mexico Community College (CNM)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.cnm.edu/programs-of-study/schools-departments/stem/aviation-maintenance-technology" target="_blank">CNM's Aviation Maintenance Technology Program</a> offers a robust curriculum covering both airframe and powerplant systems. The program emphasizes practical skills development in well-equipped facilities.</p>
            <blockquote>
                According to a study published in the Journal of Aviation/Aerospace Education & Research, hands-on training is vital to technician success. (Lutte, B. (2018). Pilot supply at the regional airlines: Airline response to the changing environment and the impact on pilot hiring. Journal of Aviation/Aerospace Education & Research, 27(1), 1-22.)
